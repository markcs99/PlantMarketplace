# Plant Images Directory

This directory should contain the following plant images:
- monstera.jpg
- snake-plant.jpg
- echeveria.jpg
- philodendron.jpg
- aloe.jpg
- tradescantia.jpg

For best results, place quality images of the respective plants in this directory to ensure the website displays correctly.

## Quick Fix
If you don't have plant images available, you can place placeholder images here with the correct filenames, or download appropriate plant images from a royalty-free image site and rename them to match these filenames.
